# User-submitted reviews per event slug.
REVIEWS: dict[str, list[str]] = {
    "metallica": [
        "Absolutely insane show. The pyrotechnics during Master of Puppets nearly melted my face off. Worth every cent.",
        "Sound quality at Olympiastadion was surprisingly great for an outdoor venue. Lars was on fire the whole night.",
        "Travelled from Poland just for this. No regrets whatsoever — they played for nearly three hours straight.",
    ],
    "taylor-swift": [
        "The Eras Tour setlist is genuinely overwhelming in the best way. She performed for over three hours and it felt like twenty minutes.",
        "Wembley atmosphere was unreal. Friendship bracelets everywhere, crowd sang every single word back to her.",
        "Not even a Swiftie going in, but I left a complete convert. The production value is on another level.",
    ],
    "coldplay": [
        "The wristbands lighting up in sync with the music turned the whole stadium into one giant light show. Magical.",
        "Athens is a perfect backdrop for Coldplay. Seeing Yellow performed under the Attic sky is something I'll never forget.",
        "Third time seeing them and they somehow get better every tour. Incredible energy for a band this deep into their career.",
    ],
    "the-weeknd": [
        "The stage setup was unlike anything I've seen — a massive rotating platform. Abel didn't miss a single note.",
        "Blinding Lights as the closer was everything. The entire Stade de France became one huge singalong.",
        "Sound mix was a little bass-heavy in my section but the visuals more than made up for it. Spectacular show.",
    ],
    "billie-eilish": [
        "Such an intimate feel for an arena show. Billie has a way of making 20,000 people feel like she's talking to just you.",
        "Happier Than Ever live is on a completely different level. I cried, not ashamed to admit it.",
        "Great production, very stripped-back compared to other pop shows which I actually appreciated. Felt genuine.",
    ],
    "ed-sheeran": [
        "One man, one guitar, one loop pedal — and he filled the entire Johan Cruijff Arena. Still can't believe it.",
        "He covered a surprise Oasis song mid-set and the crowd absolutely lost it. Setlist had something for everyone.",
        "Sitting in the standing area was a bit cramped but the show itself was flawless. Ed is just effortlessly brilliant live.",
    ],
    "beyonce": [
        "Renaissance Tour in NYC was a spiritual experience. The choreography, the costumes, the vocals — absolutely superhuman.",
        "She performed for nearly two and a half hours with zero breaks. I don't know how she does it.",
        "Arrived sceptical about the Renaissance album live — left believing it might be her best work. The staging told a story.",
    ],
    "drake": [
        "OVO Fest energy carried straight into this show. Toronto crowds are something else when Drake is on home turf.",
        "The light rig was jaw-dropping. God's Plan as the encore had the whole Scotiabank Arena in tears.",
        "Great mix of old and new — he played a ton of Take Care deep cuts which I did not expect and loved.",
    ],
    "adele": [
        "I've seen a lot of concerts but Adele's voice live is genuinely in another category. Spent most of Someone Like You crying.",
        "Caesars Palace is an intimate setting and it suits her perfectly. Felt more like a theatre performance than an arena show.",
        "She spent half the show chatting with the audience and telling stories. So funny and warm. Best night of the year.",
    ],
    "arctic-monkeys": [
        "Alex Turner walked on stage with the energy of someone who owns Sheffield. Which, let's be honest, he does.",
        "Favourite Worst Nightmare tracks live are so much heavier than on record. Brilliant sound at Utilita Arena.",
        "They played R U Mine as the second song and never looked back. Crowd was absolutely wild from start to finish.",
    ],
    "kendrick-lamar": [
        "The Grand National Tour is unlike any hip-hop show I've seen. More like performance art than a concert.",
        "Kendrick walked out to a completely silent SoFi Stadium and held the crowd in his hand for two hours. Masterful.",
        "Not Like Us live is already legendary. The crowd response was seismic — you could feel the bass in your chest.",
    ],
    "rihanna": [
        "She's still got it completely. Rude Boy and We Found Love back-to-back had everyone losing their minds.",
        "Coca-Cola Arena might be smaller than her usual venues but the energy was actually more intense for it.",
        "Production was massive — the stage extended right into the crowd. Felt like being inside the show rather than watching it.",
    ],
    "post-malone": [
        "Rockstar into Sunflower into Circles — he opened with three hits and never slowed down. Incredible setlist.",
        "Post is so much more charismatic live than I expected. Genuinely funny between songs and clearly having the time of his life.",
        "United Center sounded fantastic. The guitar sections in his newer material hit way harder in person.",
    ],
    "sabrina-carpenter": [
        "Short n' Sweet tour is genuinely the most fun I've had at a concert this year. She's a natural born performer.",
        "Every outfit change was iconic. The crowd at Avicii Arena skewed young but honestly everyone was dancing.",
        "Espresso live is absurdly catchy. She performed it twice — once at the start and once as the encore — and it was the right call both times.",
    ],
    "imagine-dragons": [
        "Thunderstruck opener with Dan Reynolds on a platform above the crowd. Allegiant Stadium was shaking.",
        "They played a career-spanning set — Radioactive to Bones — and every song got the same massive crowd reaction.",
        "Great sound mix and a genuinely tight band. Mercury is underrated as a live album and they proved it tonight.",
    ],
    "linkin-park": [
        "Emily Armstrong is an absolutely phenomenal frontwoman. She honoured Chester's legacy while making the show completely her own.",
        "Hybrid Theory played almost in full. When In the End dropped the entire Rose Bowl became one voice.",
        "Wasn't sure how I'd feel about the new lineup but they won me over completely by the third song. What a band.",
    ],
    "lady-gaga": [
        "The Mayhem Ball at Stadio Olimpico was pure theatre. Gaga changed costume eight times and delivered vocally every single time.",
        "Disease and Poker Face in the same setlist felt surreal. She bridges the gap between eras effortlessly.",
        "Rome is the perfect city for a show this dramatic and over-the-top. The crowd matched her energy all night.",
    ],
    "eminem": [
        "Slim Shady in Detroit is basically a religious event. Ford Field erupted from the first bar of Without Me.",
        "Rapped every word of Rap God at full speed live. The place went absolutely silent just watching him and then exploded after.",
        "Set ran nearly two and a half hours. My voice was gone from singing along before the end of the first hour.",
    ],
    "dua-lipa": [
        "Radical Optimism Tour is such a confident show. Dua owns the stage completely and the dancers are incredible.",
        "Levitating closing the main set had Ernst Happel Stadion bouncing in unison. Felt like one organism.",
        "Dance the Night into Physical into Don't Start Now — three songs in and I already knew it was going to be a perfect night.",
    ],
    "bruce-springsteen": [
        "Three hours and forty minutes. No support act. Just Bruce and the E Street Band and they never once let up.",
        "Dancing in the Dark with a fan pulled from the crowd — exactly like the old days. You forget how massive his catalogue is.",
        "Philadelphia crowd singing Born to Run back at him word for word. One of those nights that reminds you why live music matters.",

event ticketing platform. You help users discover upcoming concerts, check
ticket prices, find venue information, and answer any questions about events.

You have access to a tool called `fetch_event_data` that retrieves live data
from the TicketOracle platform. Use it proactively to give accurate, up-to-date
answers rather than relying on memory.

Useful endpoints (use the full http://127.0.0.1:8000 base URL):
  - All upcoming events:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/events
  - A specific event:     http://127.0.0.1:8000/events/<event_id>
  - Event reviews:        http://127.0.0.1:8000/events/<event_id>/reviews

is asking."""
